## Hi! I'm Kevin J. Zea  ðŸ‘‹

I am a Front-End developer, specialized in React.js.

Currently, student at [Platzi Master](https://platzi.com/blog/que-es-platzi-master), the Platzi's elite program exclusive to the top 0.1% of the students on the platform, developing skills in React.js, Sass, Git & GitHub, and working within the Scrum agile methodology. 

In other words...

```javascript
var kevinjzea = {
  code: ["Javascript", "HTML", "CSS"],
  tools: ["React"],
  preprocessor: ["SASS"],
  agileMethodologies: ["Scrum"],
}
```

P.S: Naturally, these will change. That's why it isn't a `const`.
